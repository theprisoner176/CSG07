#Group 07 Walking Tour Creator Project

This project allows the user to record a walk on their Android application by adding point of interests - which is associated with a title, short and long description and an image. The user can then view their walks on the website, aswell as a list of other walks. They will then be able to see any information to do with the walk on the website. 

## Development 
This project is being produced for the Android Operating System, using Java source code. We shall be using HTML5, PHP, SQl for the website which will be hosted on a local Aberystwyth filestore.
